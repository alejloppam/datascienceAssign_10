# Coursera's IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction

This capstone aims to demonstrate data science abilities. We will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully based on data publicly available.

## Objective

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.
If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch  
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.

The goal is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.

## Steps

* To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
* Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.

## Deliverables

* Jupyter notebooks and python scripts to analyze the data
* Report
